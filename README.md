# todolist-app
This script autoschedules events into your Google Calendar using a correctly formatted text file in the working directory.
This script serves as a way to remind you to do the things that you planned on doing when you woke up. It will automatically
schedule these events into "free zones" in your calendar. Meaning that if you have any "fixed" events such as going to work,
school, working out, it will fit these events into your calendar automatically. If there are no "free zones" to accomodate 
all your tasks, then the unscheduled tasks will be written to another file to be used next.

I am working on being able to send tasks through messaging, and having the script run automatically at a certain time that the
user desires. 

This is just the FIRST COMMIT
